final keyword used to make method or variable as final value. means you can 
change it after assigning.


public class Final {

	//this keyword is use for to make the variable and method 
	//immutable means we can't change/modify 
	//their value in the other class.
	final int age = 10;
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Final fin = new Final();
		//fin.age = 12;//here we can't modify;
	}
}

where finally keyword is used execute the program irrespective of try catch. you have to code them in 
finally block and after return statement you can also access the coe in finnaly and it only does not work when you forcfully 
exit from your program.

public class Finally {

	//this keyword is use for  irrespective of try ans catch if we want to execute some 
	//code then we can use finally block.
	//it is block used with try and catch block.
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Mian starts here");
		try{
			System.out.println("Try Starts ...");
			System.out.println(100/10);
			System.out.println("Try ends.");
		}
		catch(Exception e)
		{
			System.out.println("inside catch");
		}
		finally{
			System.out.println("Finally block");
		}
	}
}
